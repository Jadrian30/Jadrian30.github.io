# The Relevance of Deep Learning in Alzheimers Diagnosis
I believe the domain of Alzheimers diagnosis would benefit greatly from deep learning.
A model that analyzes brain scans from suspected alzheimers patients would be a great tool to have. 
If the model were to be created, it could potentially have the ability to detect the smallest abnormality in a suspected patient that would lead to a correct diagnosis of Alzheimers.
Although their is no cure for Alzheimers, the model could pair greatly with any sort of early-stage treatment that might become available in the future.
